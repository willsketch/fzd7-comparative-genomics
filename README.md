## Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source files and compiled PDF for a comparative genomics  
study of the Frizzled 7 (FZD7) protein, a transmembrane receptor central to the Wnt signaling pathway.  
The study aims to provide insights into its evolutionary history and the preservation or diversification of its
function over time.
