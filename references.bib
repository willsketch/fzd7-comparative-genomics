  abstract  = "Frizzled genes encode integral membrane proteins that function
               in multiple signal transduction pathways. They have been
               identified in diverse animals, from sponges to humans. The
               family is defined by conserved structural features, including
               seven hydrophobic domains and a cysteine-rich ligand-binding
               domain. Frizzled proteins are receptors for secreted Wnt
               proteins, as well as other ligands, and also play a critical
               role in the regulation of cell polarity. Frizzled genes are
               essential for embryonic development, tissue and cell polarity,
               formation of neural synapses, and the regulation of
               proliferation, and many other processes in developing and adult
               organisms; mutations in human frizzled-4 have been linked to
               familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. It is not yet clear how
               Frizzleds couple to downstream effectors, and this is a focus of
               intense study.",

  abstract  = "Amino acid substitution models play a crucial role in
               phylogenetic analyses. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods have been
               proposed to estimate amino acid substitution models; however,
               they are typically complicated and slow. In this article, we
               propose QMaker, a new ML method to estimate a general
               time-reversible $Q$ matrix from a large protein data set
               consisting of multiple sequence alignments. QMaker combines an
               efficient ML tree search algorithm, a model selection for
               handling the model heterogeneity among alignments, and the
               consideration of rate mixture models among sites. We provide
               QMaker as a user-friendly function in the IQ-TREE software
               package (http://www.iqtree.org) supporting the use of multiple
               CPU cores so that biologists can easily estimate amino acid
               substitution models from their own protein alignments. We used
               QMaker to estimate new empirical general amino acid substitution
               models from the current Pfam database as well as five
               clade-specific models for mammals, birds, insects, yeasts, and
               plants. Our results show that the new models considerably
               improve the fit between model and data and in some cases
               influence the inference of phylogenetic tree topologies.[Amino

               the cytochrome {B} and cytochrome oxidase subunit {I}
               mitochondrial genes",
  author    = "Tobe, Shanan S and Kitchener, Andrew C and Linacre, Adrian M T",
  abstract  = "The phylogeny and taxonomy of mammalian species were originally
               based upon shared or derived morphological characteristics.
               However, genetic analyses have more recently played an
               increasingly important role in confirming existing or
               establishing often radically different mammalian groupings and
               phylogenies. The two most commonly used genetic loci in species
               identification are the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) and the
               cytochrome b gene (cyt b). For the first time this study
               provides a detailed comparison of the effectiveness of these two
               loci in reconstructing the phylogeny of mammals at different
               levels of the taxonomic hierarchy in order to provide a basis
               for standardizing methodologies in the future. Interspecific and
               intraspecific variation is assessed and for the first time, to
               our knowledge, statistical confidence is applied to sequence
               comparisons. Comparison of the DNA sequences of 217 mammalian
               species reveals that cyt b more accurately reconstructs their
               phylogeny and known relationships between species based on other
               molecular and morphological analyses at Super Order, Order,
               Family and generic levels. Cyt b correctly assigned 95.85\% of
               mammal species to Super Order, 94.31\% to Order and 98.16\% to
               Family compared to 78.34\%, 93.36\% and 96.93\% respectively for
               COI. Cyt b also gives better resolution when separating species
               based on sequence data. Using a Kimura 2-parameter p-distance
               (x100) threshold of 1.5-2.5, cyt b gives a better resolution for
               separating species with a lower false positive rate and higher
               positive predictive value than those of COI.",
